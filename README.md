# Tahoe21

Starter project for a web-based Tahoe 21 (Blackjack) game, scaffolded from the Tahoe 5 codebase.

## Next steps
- Replace poker game logic in `app/app.js` with blackjack gameplay/state.
- Update branding text in `app/index.html`.
- Add Tahoe 21 logo and card-back assets in `app/assets/`.
- Keep responsive/mobile layout and deployment workflow from the scaffold.

## Run locally
From this folder:

```bash
cd app
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080`.
